# Frontend Mentor - News Homepage Solution

This is my solution to the [News homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl). This challenge helped me improve my skills in building modern, responsive layouts using Next.js and Material UI.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - Component library for styling

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge of responsive design principles. I focused on:

- Implementing **dynamic layouts** using Material UI's Grid system
- Using **Next.js Image component** for optimized image loading
- Improving accessibility by ensuring all elements are keyboard and screen-reader-friendly

Here’s a snippet demonstrating my use of Material UI’s Grid system:

```jsx
<Grid container spacing={3}>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={8}>
    <Image src="/assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg" alt="Web 3.0" width={700} height={400} />
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore **server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)** with Next.js
- Implement **dark mode toggle** using Material UI's theme customization
- Enhance performance optimization by lazy-loading images and components

### Useful Resources

- [Material UI Documentation](https://mui.com/) - Helped with styling and component implementation
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Provided insights on performance optimizations
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Great place for feedback and improvement
